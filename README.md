# RSE-for-open-quantum-systems
Python implementation of the Resonant State Expansion for open 1D quantum well systems

## Overview

This repository provides a Python module ('rse.py') containing a set of functions useful for the analysis of resonances in open one-dimensional quantum well systems using the Resonant State Expansion (RSE) approach, as well as a notebook ('examples.ipynb') containing a collection of usage examples for each function.\
The aim of this repository is to assist students and researchers who are working on similar projects.\
It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with all the relevant theoretical background. The foundational work on the quantum-mechanical version of the RSE can be found [here](https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/114238/).

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for improvements, alternative implementations, or additional examples, you are encouraged to contribute to the codebase. Your contributions can help make this resource even more valuable for fellow students and researchers.\
**How to contribute:**
*   If you have ideas for enhancing the existing functions or adding new ones, feel free to submit pull requests.
*   If you discover issues or bugs, please report them on the repository's issue tracker.
*   Share your insights, feedback, and suggestions to improve the clarity and effectiveness of the explanations and the code.
*   If you come across other scenarios or quantum systems that you'd like to see covered, consider contributing new code and examples.

## Future additions

Further examples will be added in the notebook, covering topics such as error evaluation, computing wavefunctions and expansion coefficients, and locating exceptional points.
